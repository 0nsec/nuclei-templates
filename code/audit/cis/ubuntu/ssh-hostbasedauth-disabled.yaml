  name: Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication - disabled
  author: Th3l0newolf
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template checks if HostbasedAuthentication is disabled in SSH configuration.
    HostbasedAuthentication is a security risk as it allows authentication based on host identity,
    relying on DNS and hostname resolution which can be spoofed. Following CIS Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS
    security guidelines, this feature should be disabled to prevent unauthorized access attempts.
  remediation: Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to set 'HostbasedAuthentication no' and restart SSH service with 'sudo systemctl restart sshd'.
