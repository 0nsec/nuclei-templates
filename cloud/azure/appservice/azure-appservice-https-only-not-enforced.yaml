  name: Azure App Service HTTPS-Only Not Enforced
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Azure App Service web applications redirect all non-secure HTTP traffic to HTTPS in order to encrypt the communication between applications and web clients. HTTPS uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to provide a secure connection, which is both encrypted and authenticated. This adds an extra layer of security to the HTTP requests made to the web application.
  impact: |
    Not enforcing HTTPS only for web applications can lead to unencrypted and unauthenticated traffic, which can be intercepted by attackers.
  remediation: |
    Enable the HTTPS-only feature on all Azure App Services to enforce all traffic to be encrypted and secure.
