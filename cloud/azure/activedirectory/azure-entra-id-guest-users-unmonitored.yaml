  name: Azure Entra ID Guest Users Unmonitored
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    For a Microsoft Azure business-to-business (B2B) collaboration, each Microsoft Entra ID guest user needs to be associated with a business owner or business process. Ensure that there are no unassociated Microsoft Entra ID guest users within your Microsoft Azure account when there is no need for B2B collaboration.
  impact: |
    Presence of unmonitored Microsoft Entra ID guest users can lead to unauthorized access and potential security risks within the Azure environment.
  remediation: |
    Regularly review and monitor guest users in Microsoft Entra ID to ensure each is associated with a business owner or process. Remove any unnecessary guest user accounts.
