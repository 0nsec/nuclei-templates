  name: Azure Storage Account Not Using BYOK
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that your Azure Storage accounts are using customer-managed keys (also known as Bring Your Own Keys - BYOKs) instead of service-managed keys (default keys used by Microsoft Azure for data encryption), in order to have a more granular control over your Azure Storage data encryption and decryption process.
  impact: |
    Not using BYOK for data encryption in Azure Storage accounts can limit your control over the encryption keys and may not comply with certain regulatory requirements.
  remediation: |
    Configure your Azure Storage accounts to use customer-managed keys (BYOK) for data encryption to ensure compliance and enhanced security.
