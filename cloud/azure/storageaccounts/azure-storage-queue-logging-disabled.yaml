  name: Azure Storage Queue Logging Not Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that Microsoft Azure Storage Queue service logging is enabled for read, write, and delete requests. The Storage Queue service records details of both successful and failed requests, including end-to-end latency, server latency, and authentication information, which is crucial for security and compliance.
  impact: |
    Not enabling logging for Azure Storage Queue can result in insufficient data for auditing and lack of visibility into access patterns, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
  remediation: |
    Enable logging for read, write, and delete requests in Azure Storage Queue service to ensure compliance and improve security monitoring.
