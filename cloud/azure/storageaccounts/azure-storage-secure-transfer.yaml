  name: Azure Storage Secure Transfer Not Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that all data transferred between clients and your Azure Storage account is encrypted using the HTTPS protocol. A Microsoft Azure Storage account contains data objects such as files, blobs, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP/HTTPS. All data stored within your Azure Storage account is secure, scalable, durable, and highly available.
  impact: |
    If HTTPS is not enforced, data in transit between clients and Azure Storage resources (files, blobs, queues, tables, and disks) may be transmitted unencrypted, exposing it to potential interception and tampering.
  remediation: |
    Enable "Secure transfer required" in your Azure Storage account settings to enforce HTTPS traffic only, ensuring all data in transit is encrypted.
