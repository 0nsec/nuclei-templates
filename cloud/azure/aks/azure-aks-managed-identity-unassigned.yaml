  name: Use System-Assigned Managed Identities for AKS Clusters
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters are using system-assigned managed identities to allow secure application access to other Azure cloud resources such as load balancers, managed disks, and key vaults.
  impact: |
    Not using system-assigned managed identities for AKS clusters can lead to inadequate security control, making it difficult to manage permissions and access securely.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that all AKS clusters are configured to use system-assigned managed identities. This can be set during the AKS cluster creation or can be updated on existing clusters.
