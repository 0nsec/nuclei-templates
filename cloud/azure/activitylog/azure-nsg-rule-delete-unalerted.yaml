  name: Azure NSG Rule Delete Alert Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is used to detect "Delete Network Security Group Rule" events in your Microsoft Azure cloud account. Activity log alerts get activated when a new activity log event that matches the condition specified in the alert occurs. In this case, the condition used is 'Whenever the Administrative Activity Log "Delete Security Rule (networkSecurityGroups/securityRules)" has "any" level with "any" status and event is initiated by "any"'.
  impact: |
    Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Delete Network Security Group Rule" events, unauthorized or unwanted changes might go unnoticed, leading to potential security risks.
  remediation: |
    Ensure alert rules are properly configured to monitor and notify on "Delete Network Security Group Rule" events by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/delete" and ensuring that an action group is attached to manage notifications.
