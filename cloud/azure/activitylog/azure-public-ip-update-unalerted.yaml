  name: Azure Public IP Create/Update Alert Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that activity log alerts are used to detect "Create or Update Public IP Address" events within your Microsoft Azure cloud account. An activity log alert gets activated when a new activity log event that matches the condition specified in the alert occurs.
  impact: |
    Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Create or Update Public IP Address" events, unauthorized or unwanted changes might go unnoticed, leading to potential security risks.
  remediation: |
    Ensure alert rules are properly configured to monitor and notify on "Create or Update Public IP Address" events by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write" and ensuring that an action group is attached to manage notifications.
