  name: Azure VM Managed Identity Not Assigned
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Microsoft Azure virtual machines (VMs) have system-assigned managed identities enabled in order to allow secure virtual machine access to Azure resources such as key vaults and storage accounts.
  impact: |
    VMs without system-assigned managed identities may have inadequate security configurations, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to Azure resources.
  remediation: |
    Enable system-assigned managed identities on all Azure VMs to ensure secure access to other Azure services.
