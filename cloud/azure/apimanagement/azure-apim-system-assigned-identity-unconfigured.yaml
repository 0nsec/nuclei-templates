  name: Azure API Management Service System-Assigned Managed Identity Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Azure API Management service instances are using system-assigned managed identities in order to allow secure access to other Microsoft Azure protected resources such as Azure Key Vaults. Using system-assigned managed identities minimizes risks, simplifies management, and maintains compliance with evolving cloud services.
  impact: |
    If system-assigned managed identities are not enabled for Azure API Management service instances, it may lead to insecure access management and complicates credentials management, increasing the risk of security breaches.
  remediation: |
    Enable system-assigned managed identities for your Azure API Management service instances through the Azure portal or by configuring the ARM template of your instance to include a system-assigned identity.
