  name: Publicly Accessible DMS Replication Instances
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Amazon Database Migration Service (DMS) are not publicly accessible from the Internet in order to avoid exposing private data and minimize security risks.
  impact: |
    Publicly accessible DMS replication instances expose your database to unauthorized access and potential attacks, increasing the risk of data breaches and compromising the security of sensitive information.
  remediation: |
    Restrict access to your DMS replication instances by configuring security groups and network access controls to allow connections only from trusted IP addresses and private subnets, ensuring that they are not publicly accessible.
