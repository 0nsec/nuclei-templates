info:
  name: Firehose Delivery Stream Destination Encryption - Disabled
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that your Kinesis Firehose delivery stream data records are encrypted at destination (i.e. Amazon S3) in order to meet regulatory requirements and protect your Firehose data at rest.
  impact: |
    Disabling encryption for Firehose delivery stream destinations can lead to sensitive data being stored unencrypted, increasing the risk of data exposure and unauthorized access.
  remediation: |
    Enable encryption for Firehose delivery stream destinations to ensure that all data is encrypted at rest, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
