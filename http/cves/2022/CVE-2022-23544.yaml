id: CVE-2022-23544

info:
  name: MeterSphere < 2.5.0 SSRF
  author: j4vaovo
  severity: medium
  description: |
    MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send crafted requests to internal resources, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade MeterSphere to version 2.5.0 or later to mitigate the SSRF vulnerability.
