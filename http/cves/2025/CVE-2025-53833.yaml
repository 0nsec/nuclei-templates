info:
  name: LaRecipe < 2.8.1 Remote Code Execution via SSTI
  author: iamnoooob,pdresearch
  severity: critical
  description: |
    LaRecipe is an application that allows users to create documentation with Markdown inside a Laravel app. Versions prior to 2.8.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in vulnerable configurations. Attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive environment variables, and/or escalate access depending on server configuration.
  remediation: Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version v2.8.1 or later to receive a patch.
