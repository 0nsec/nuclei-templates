  author: princechaddha,Mr.Bobo HP
  severity: info
  description: |
    Checks whether cookies in the HTTP response contain the HttpOnly attribute. If the HttpOnly flag is set, it means that the cookie is HTTP-only
  impact: |
    Lack of HttpOnly flag on cookies increases the risk of client-side attacks, compromising user session security and data privacy.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that all cookies are set with the HttpOnly attribute to prevent client-side access.
