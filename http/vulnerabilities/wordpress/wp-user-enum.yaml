  name: WordPress REST API User Enumeration
  author: Manas_Harsh,daffainfo,geeknik,dr0pd34d
  severity: low
  description: |
    The REST API exposed user data for all users who had authored a post of a public post type. WordPress 4.7.1 limits this to only post types which have specified that they should be shown within the REST API.
  impact: |
    An attacker can easily determine valid usernames, which can lead to targeted attacks such as brute force attacks or social engineering.
  remediation: |
    Install a WordPress plugin such as Stop User Enumeration. Stop User Enumeration is a security plugin designed to detect and prevent hackers scanning your site for user names.
