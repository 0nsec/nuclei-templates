  name: Dkron - Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
  author: icarot
  severity: high
  description: |
    An exposed Dkron server, a distributed and fault-tolerant job scheduling system for cloud-native environments, was found vulnerable to unauthenticated remote command execution (RCE).This flaw allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host without authentication.
