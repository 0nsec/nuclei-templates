  name: FTP Service Running Check
  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: Verify that the FTP service (ftpsvc) is not running, as its operation transmits credentials unencrypted, making them vulnerable to sniffing attacks.
  impact: |
    If the FTP service is running, attackers may capture clear-text credentials via simple network sniffing tools.
  remediation: |
    Disable the FTP service by executing:
    > net stop ftpsvc
    > sc config ftpsvc start= disabled
    or disable it via the Services management console.
