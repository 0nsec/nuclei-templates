  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: Verify that the Administrators group contains only the minimal necessary accounts. Excess accounts may expose the system to elevated risks.

  remediation: |
    Remove unnecessary accounts from the Administrators group via:
    > net localgroup administrators [AccountName] /del
    or through Computer Management.
