  name: Share Permissions and User Group Settings Check
  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Verify that non-default shared directories do not include the "Everyone" group in their share permissions.
    Default shares (C$, D$, Admin$, IPC$) are exempt from this check.
  impact: |
    Inclusion of "Everyone" in share permissions for non-default shares may allow unauthorized or anonymous access to shared resources.
  remediation: |
    Remove the "Everyone" group from share permissions for any non-default shared folder.
