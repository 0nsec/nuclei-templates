  severity: medium
  description: |
    Verify that unnecessary services (Alerter, Clipbook, Messenger, Simple TCP/IP Services) are not running.
    These services, if active, may expose the system to security risks.
  impact: |
    Running these services can provide attackers with a means to exploit the system, as they are known to be vulnerable.
  remediation: |
    Stop and disable these services using:
    > net stop [ServiceName]
    > sc config [ServiceName] start= disabled
    or via the Services management console.
