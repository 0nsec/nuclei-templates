  name: DNS Zone Transfer Check
  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Verify that DNS zone transfers are restricted by ensuring that the SecureSecondaries registry value is set to 2 for all active zones.
    Unauthorized zone transfers can leak critical domain information, aiding attackers in mapping network structures.
  impact: |
    If DNS zone transfers are not properly restricted, attackers may obtain domain and zone information, which can be used to plan further attacks on network infrastructure.
  remediation: |
    Configure DNS zone transfer restrictions by:
    - Disabling zone transfers, or
    - Allowing transfers only to specific servers by setting the SecureSecondaries registry value to 2.
