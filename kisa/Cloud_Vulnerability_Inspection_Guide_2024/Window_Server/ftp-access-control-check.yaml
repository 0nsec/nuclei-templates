  name: FTP Access Control Check
  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Verify that FTP access is restricted by applying IP address restrictions. If no IP restriction settings are configured,
    unauthorized networks may gain access to FTP services.
  impact: |
    Without proper IP-based access control, FTP services can be accessed from unauthorized networks,
    increasing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
  remediation: |
    Configure IP address restrictions via IIS Manager:
    - Open IIS Manager.
    - Navigate to the FTP site â†’ FTP IP Address and Domain Restrictions.
    - Add allowed IP addresses and set appropriate deny rules.
