  name: Password Expiry Setting Check
  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: Verify that the "password never expires" setting is disabled for all active accounts to ensure password expiration policies are effective.
  impact: |
    If the "password never expires" setting is enabled, even with a maximum password age configured, the policy will not be enforced,
    increasing the risk of credential compromise.
  remediation: |
    Disable the "password never expires" setting via:
    > wmic useraccount where name="USERNAME" set passwordexpires=true
    or through Local Security Policy.
