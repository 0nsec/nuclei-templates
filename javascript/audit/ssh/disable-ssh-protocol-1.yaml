  name: Disable SSH Protocol 1
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: low
  description: |
    Using SSH Protocol 1 is insecure as it lacks strong encryption and integrity checks, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, and other exploits. It is recommended to use SSH Protocol 2 for enhanced security.
  remediation: |
    Set Protocol 2 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to disable SSH Protocol 1 and restart the SSH service.
