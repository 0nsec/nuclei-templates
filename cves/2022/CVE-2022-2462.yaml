info:
  name: Transposh WordPress Translation 1.0.8.1 Information Disclosure
  author: dwisiswant0
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Transposh WordPress Translation versions 1.0.8.1 and below have an ajax action
    called "tp_history" which is intended to return data about who has translated a
    text given by the "token" parameter. However, the plugin also returns the user's
    login name as part of the "user_login" attribute. Successful exploits can allow
    an unauthenticated attacker to leak the WordPress username of translators. If an
    anonymous user submitted the translation, then the user's IP address is returned.
