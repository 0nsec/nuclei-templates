id: CVE-2019-12990

info:
  name: Citrix SD-WAN Center - Unauthenticated Directory Traversal File Write
  author: gy741
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The applianceSettingsFileTransfer action in ApplianceSettingsController is susceptible to directory traversal by a remote, unauthenticated attacker. Specifically, the applianceSettingsFileTransfer function does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values that are used to construct a file system path. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic through the Collector controller and supplying a crafted values for filename, filedata, and workspace_id. This vulnerability can be exploited to write files to locations writable by the www-data user. Furthermore, an attacker could write a crafted PHP file to /home/talariuser/www/app/webroot/files/ to execute arbitrary PHP code.
